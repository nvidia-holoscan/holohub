### XrFrame Operator

The `XrFrameOp` directory contains the `XrBeginFrameOp` and the `XrEndFrameOp`. `XrBeginFrameOp` operator initiates the rendering of a single OpenXR frame. It converts render buffers and events generated by the OpenXR runtime into Holoscan specific events to be consumed by downstream operators. Application specific operators are then expected to render left and right camera views into the given color and depth buffers. Once complete, the buffers must be passed to `XrEndFrameOp` in order to deliver the frame back to the OpenXR runtime. Note that a single connection xr_frame from `XrBeginFrameOp` to `XrEndFrameOp` is required to synchronize the OpenXR calls issued by the two operators.
