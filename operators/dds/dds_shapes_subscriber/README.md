### DDS Shape Subscriber Operator

The DDS Shape Subscriber Operator subscribes to and reads from the `Square`, `Circle`, and
`Triangle` shape topics as used by the [RTI Shapes Demo](https://www.rti.com/free-trial/shapes-demo).
It will then translate the received shape data to an internal `Shape` datatype for output
to downstream operators.

This operator requires an installation of [RTI Connext Express](https://content.rti.com/l/983311/2025-07-08/q5x1n8) to provide access to the DDS domain, as specified by the [OMG Data-Distribution Service](https://www.omg.org/omg-dds-portal/).
