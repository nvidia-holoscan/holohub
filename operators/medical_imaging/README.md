### Medical Imaging Processing and Inference Operators

This set of operators accelerate the development of medical imaging AI inference application with DICOM imaging network integration by providing the following,

- application classes to automate the inference with MONAI Bundle as well as normal TorchScript models
- classes to load supported AI model from files to detected devices, GPU or CPU
- classes to parse runtime options and well-known environment variables
- DICOM study parsing and selection classes, as well as DICOM instance to volume image conversion
- DICOM instance writers to encapsulate AI inference results in these DICOM OID,
  - DICOM Segmentation
  - DICOM Basic Text Structured Report
  - DICOM Encapsulated PDF
- Surface mesh generation and storage in STL format
- Visualization with [Clara-Viz](https://pypi.org/project/clara-viz/) integration, as needed
