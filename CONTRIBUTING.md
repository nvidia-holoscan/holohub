### Naming Conventions

For an operator named "Adaptive Thresholding":

| Component | Convention | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Class Name | TitleCase + "Op" suffix | `AdaptiveThresholdingOp` |
| metadata.json "name" | Same as class name | `AdaptiveThresholdingOp` |
| Directory | snake_case | `adaptive_thresholding` |
| Filename | Same as directory + extension | `adaptive_thresholding.py` |
| README Title | Title Case + "Operator" | "Adaptive Thresholding Operator" |
| Unit Test | "test_" + directory name | `test_adaptive_thresholding.py` |

### Build System Integration

All contributions that include code need to be integrated with HoloHub's build system using CMake. Edit the appropriate `CMakeLists.txt` to add your contribution:

**For Operators:**

```cmake
# In ./operators/CMakeLists.txt
add_holohub_operator(my_operator DEPENDS EXTENSIONS my_extension)
```

If the operator wraps a GXF extension then the optional `DEPENDS EXTENSIONS` should be added to tell the build system to build the dependent extension(s).

**For Extensions:**

```cmake
# In ./gxf_extensions/CMakeLists.txt
add_holohub_extension(my_extension)
```

**For Applications:**

```cmake
# In ./applications/CMakeLists.txt
add_holohub_application(my_application DEPENDS
                        OPERATORS my_operator1 my_operator2)
```

If the application relies on one or more operators then the optional `DEPENDS OPERATORS` should be added so that
the build system knows to build the dependent operator(s).

**For Workflows:**

```cmake
# In ./workflow/CMakeLists.txt
add_holohub_application(my_workflow DEPENDS
                        OPERATORS my_operator1 my_operator2)
```

If the workflow relies on one or more operators then the optional `DEPENDS OPERATORS` should be added so that
the build system knows to build the dependent operator(s).

**For Packages:**

**CMake Configuration:**

```cmake
# In ./pkg/my_package/CMakeLists.txt
holohub_configure_deb(
  NAME "my-package-dev"
  COMPONENTS "my-headers" "my-libs"  # optional
  DESCRIPTION "My project description"
  VERSION "1.0.0"
  VENDOR "Your Organization"
  CONTACT "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
  DEPENDS "libc6 (>= 2.34), libstdc++6 (>= 11)"
  SECTION "devel"      # optional
  PRIORITY "optional"  # optional
)
```

**Package Registration:**

```cmake
# In ./pkg/CMakeLists.txt
add_holohub_package(my_packager
                    APPLICATIONS my_app1
                    OPERATORS my_op1 my_op2)
```

**Prerequisites:**
Ensure your CMake targets have `install` rules defined. Use `COMPONENT` to control packaging granularity.

## Code Quality and Standards

### Linting and Code Quality

HoloHub enforces code quality through automated linting checks that run in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Installing Lint Tools

```bash
./holohub lint --install-dependencies
```

#### Running Lint Checks

```bash
# Lint entire repository
./holohub lint

# Lint specific path
./holohub lint path/to/your/code
```

#### Fixing Common Lint Issues

```bash
./holohub lint --fix
```

### Testing

#### Integration tests

Each operator should have at least one associated [application](./applications/) demonstrating its capabilities.

#### Writing Tests

Applications should include a testing section in their `CMakeLists.txt` for functional testing. HoloHub uses [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) for automated testing.

#### Running Tests

```bash
./holohub test <project>
```

### Unit Testing Python Operators

HoloHub strongly encourages unit tests for Python operators.

#### Testing Framework and Structure

- **Framework**: Use `pytest`
- **File Location**: Same directory as operator: `test_<operator_name>.py`
- **Fixtures**: Reuse common fixtures from `conftest.py`

#### Required Test Categories

1. **Initialization Tests**: Verify operator creation and properties
2. **Port Setup Tests**: Ensure input/output ports are configured correctly
3. **Error Handling Tests**: Test invalid arguments using `pytest.raises`
4. **Compute Logic Tests**: Test main functionality with various inputs
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Cover boundary conditions and error scenarios

#### Example Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from .my_operator import MyOperatorOp
from holoscan.core import Operator, _Operator as BaseOperator


def test_my_operator_init(fragment):
    name = "myoperator_op"
    op = MyOperatorOp(fragment=fragment, name=name, tensor_name="image")
    assert isinstance(op, BaseOperator), "MyOperator should be a Holoscan operator"
    assert op.operator_type == Operator.OperatorType.NATIVE, "Operator type should be NATIVE"
    assert f"name: {name}" in repr(op), "Operator name should appear in repr()"

@pytest.mark.parametrize("shape", [(32, 32, 3), (16, 16, 1)])
def test_my_operator_compute(fragment, op_input_factory, op_output, execution_context, mock_image, shape):
    image = mock_image(shape)
    op_input = op_input_factory(image, tensor_name="image", port="in")
    op = MyOperatorOp(fragment=fragment, tensor_name="image")
    op.compute(op_input, op_output, execution_context)
    out_msg, out_port = op_output.emitted
    assert out_port == "out"
    assert out_msg["image"].shape == shape
    # the rest of compute logic that covers the main functionality of the operator

def test_my_operator_invalid_param(fragment):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        MyOperatorOp(fragment=fragment, tensor_name="image", invalid_param=-1)

# Add as many test cases as needed to cover all the functionality of the operator and the edge cases.
```

#### Running Python Unit Tests

```bash
# From repository root
pytest operators/<your_operator_dir>/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=operators/<your_operator_dir>/ operators/<your_operator_dir>/

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v operators/<your_operator_dir>/
```

#### Best Practices

- **Test Isolation**: Keep tests independent and isolated
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test function names
- **Assertion Messages**: Include helpful assertion messages
- **Parameterized Tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple scenarios
- **Fixture Reuse**: Leverage common fixtures from `conftest.py`
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings explaining test purpose

For examples, see existing test files like:

- `operators/deidentification/pixelator/test_pixelator.py`
- `conftest.py` for available fixtures
