# [Operators](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub/tree/main/operators)

Operators are fundamental components that extend the functionality of the Holoscan SDK, enabling developers to build custom AI sensor processing workflows. 
These operators are designed to handle specific tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing, model inference, and postprocessing, and can be seamlessly integrated into Holoscan applications. 
The repository provides a collection of pre-built operators that serve as reference implementations, demonstrating best practices for efficient and scalable AI processing.
