# Ultrasound Bone Scoliosis Segmentation

Full workflow including a generic visualization of segmentation results from a spinal scoliosis segmentation model of ultrasound videos. The model used is stateless, so this workflow could be configured to adapt to any vanilla DNN model. 

### Requirements

The provided applications are configured to use the DELTACAST.TV capture card for input stream. Contact [DELTACAST.TV](https://www.deltacast.tv/) for more details on their products and how to setup your environment.
