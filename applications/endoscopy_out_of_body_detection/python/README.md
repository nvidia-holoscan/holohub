# Endoscopy Out of Body Detection

![Endoscopy Out of Body Detection Workflow](../endoscopy_out_of_body_detection.png)

## Overview

This application performs real-time detection of whether an endoscope is inside or outside the body during endoscopic procedures. For each input frame, the application:

- Classifies the frame as either "in-body" or "out-of-body"
- Provides a confidence score for the classification
- Outputs either to the console or to a CSV file (when analytics is enabled)

__Note: This application does not include visualization components.__

## Quick Start

Run the following command to build and launch the application on a supported Holoscan platform:

```bash
./holohub run endoscopy_out_of_body_detection --language python
```

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Holoscan SDK (version 0.5 or higher)
- [A supported Holoscan platform or workstation with a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html)
- CMake build system
- FFmpeg (for data conversion)

## Data Requirements

### Model and Sample Data

The endoscopy detection model and sample datasets are available on [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara-holoscan/resources/endoscopy_out_of_body_detection). The package includes:

- Pre-trained ONNX model for out-of-body detection: `out_of_body_detection.onnx`
- Sample endoscopy video clips (MP4 format): `sample_clip_out_of_body_detection.mp4`

### Data Preparation (optional)

The application requires the input videos to be converted to GXF tensor format. This conversion happens automatically during building, but manual conversion can be done following these steps:

1. Download and extract the data:

    ```bash
    unzip [NGC_DOWNLOAD].zip -d <data_dir>
    ```

2. Convert the video to GXF tensor format using the provided script:

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -i <INPUT_VIDEO_FILE> -fs 900M -pix_fmt rgb24 -f rawvideo pipe:1 | \
    python convert_video_to_gxf_entities.py --width 256 --height 256 --channels 3 --framerate 30
    ```

    Note: The conversion script (`convert_video_to_gxf_entities.py`) is available in the [Holoscan SDK repository](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/tree/main/scripts).

3. Organize the data directory as follows:

    ```bash
    data/
    └── endoscopy_out_of_body_detection/
      ├── LICENSE.md
      ├── out_of_body_detection.onnx
      ├── sample_clip_out_of_body_detection.gxf_entities
      ├── sample_clip_out_of_body_detection.gxf_index
      └── sample_clip_out_of_body_detection.mp4
    ```

## Configuration

The application uses `endoscopy_out_of_body_detection.yaml` for configuration. Key settings include:

- Input video parameters in the `replayer` section
- Model parameters in the `inference` section
- Analytics settings for data export

## Building and running the application

You can simply run the application with the following command:

```bash
./holohub run endoscopy_out_of_body_detection --language python
```

It builds and starts a Docker container, and then builds and runs the application inside the container.

For more information, see the Holohub [README.md](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub/blob/main/README.md).

### Running in development mode

You can also run the application with customized arguments, you can use Holohub CLI for creating and starting the Holohub container, and then building and running the application inside the container as follows:

1. Create and start the Holohub container:

    ```bash
    ./holohub run-container endoscopy_out_of_body_detection
    ```

2. Build the application:

    Once in the docker container, you can build the application by running the following command:

    ```bash
    ./holohub build endoscopy_out_of_body_detection --language python
    ```

3. Run the application:

    After building the application, you can run it from your build directory with the following command for the basic usage and can modify the arguments as needed:

    ```bash
    applications/endoscopy_out_of_body_detection/endoscopy_out_of_body_detection.py \
      --config endoscopy_out_of_body_detection.yaml \
      --data ../data/endoscopy_out_of_body_detection
    ```

### Analytics Mode

To enable analytics and export results to CSV:

1. Set `enable_analytics: true` in the configuration file:

  ```yaml
  # endoscopy_out_of_body_detection.yaml
  enable_analytics: true
  ```

2. Configure analytics output (optional):

  ```bash
  # Set output directory (default: current directory)
  export HOLOSCAN_ANALYTICS_DATA_DIRECTORY="/path/to/output"

  # Set output filename (default: data.csv)
  export HOLOSCAN_ANALYTICS_DATA_FILE_NAME="results.csv"
  ```

The application will create:

- A directory named after the application
- Subdirectories with timestamps for each run
- CSV files containing frame-by-frame classification results

## Output Format

- __Console Mode__: Displays "Likely in-body" or "Likely out-of-body" along with confidence scores for each frame.

- __Analytics Mode__: Outputs a CSV file with frame-by-frame classification results in the following format:

  ```csv
  In-body,Out-of-body,Confidence Score
  1,0,0.972432
  1,0,0.902066
  ```
