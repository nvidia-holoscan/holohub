# Multi-AI Ultrasound

This application demonstrates how to run multiple inference pipelines in a single application by leveraging the Holoscan Inference module, a framework that facilitates designing and executing inference applications in the Holoscan SDK.

The Multi AI operators (inference and postprocessor) use APIs from the Holoscan Inference module to extract data, initialize and execute the inference workflow, process, and transmit data for visualization.

The applications uses models and echocardiogram data from iCardio.ai. The models include:
- a Plax chamber model, that identifies four critical linear measurements of the heart
- a Viewpoint Classifier model, that determines confidence of each frame to known 28 cardiac anatomical view as defined by the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography
- an Aortic Stenosis Classification model, that provides a score which determines likeability for the presence of aortic stenosis

### Requirements

The provided applications are configured to either use the AJA capture card for input stream, or a pre-recorded video of the echocardiogram (replayer). Follow the [setup instructions from the user guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara-holoscan/sdk-user-guide/aja_setup.html) to use the AJA capture card.

### Build Instructions

Please refer to the top level Holohub README.md file for information on how to build this application.

### Run Instructions

In your build directory, run the commands of your choice:

* Using a pre-recorded video
    ```bash
    # C++
    sed -i -e 's#applications/multiai_ultrasound/data/#<data_dir>/#' <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound.yaml
    sed -i -e 's#^source:.*#source: replayer#' <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound.yaml
    <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound
    ```

* Using an AJA card
    ```bash
    # C++
    sed -i -e 's#applications/multiai_ultrasound/data/#<data_dir>/#' <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound.yaml
    sed -i -e 's#^source:.*#source: aja#' <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound.yaml
    <build_dir>/multiai_ultrasound
    ```
