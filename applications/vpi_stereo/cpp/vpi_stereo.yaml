# Parameters for VPI's stereo disparity estimator
# notes:
# - 256 maxDisparity means values in the range 0-255
# - inputs are rescaled to width,height prior to disparity estimation, so disparity values are relative to the width
#   given here and not the original input video width.
# - downscaleFactor must be 1 on x86_64.
# - On IGX/AGX/NX systems, larger downscaleFactor will allow the hardware accelerator to operate in
#   sub-sampling mode for better performance (disparity values still relative to width).
