# Polyp Detection

This application demonstrates how to run polyp detection models on live video in real-time.

The model: [RT-DETR v2](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR) is trained on the [REAL-Colon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03359-0) dataset.

Compared to the `SSD` object detection model described in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03359-0), `RT-DETR` demonstrates improvements. The table below shows metrics for SSD obtained from Table 3 of the paper, and metrics for RT-DETR calculated on the same test set (using all test images from the `REAL-Colon` dataset).

| Method  | MAP@0.5 | MAP@0.5:0.95 |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| SSD     | 0.338   | 0.216        |
| RT-DETR | 0.452   | 0.301        |


## Run Instructions

### Build the application

[üì¶Ô∏è (NGC) Sample App Model for AI Polyp Detection](https://registry.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvstaging/teams/holoscan/models/polyp_detection_rt_detr_model)

The data will be automatically downloaded and converted to the correct format when building the application with the following command:

```Bash
./holohub run polyp_detection
```

### Data

[üì¶Ô∏è (NGC) Sample App Data for AI Colonoscopy Segmentation of Polyps](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara-holoscan/resources/holoscan_colonoscopy_sample_data)

The sample data is automatically downloaded and converted to the correct format when building the application.

If you would like to use data from the [REAL-Colon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03359-0) dataset, please refer to the sample script `prepare_real_colon_sample_data.py` included in this repository. Note that this script requires additional dependencies. You can install them with:

```Bash
pip install requests tqdm opencv-python
```

If you want to manually convert the video data, please refer to the instructions for using the [convert_video_to_gxf_entities](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/tree/main/scripts#convert_video_to_gxf_entitiespy) script.

### Run the application

```Bash
./run launch polyp_detection
```

If you want to manually run the application, please refer to the following instructions:

- Ensure that the `rtdetrv2_timm_r50_nvimagenet_pretrained_neg_finetune_bhwc.onnx` file is located in the directory specified by the `data` argument.
- Verify that the generated video files (`.gxf_index` and `.gxf_entities` files) are in the directory specified by the `video_dir` argument.
- Specify the correct video width and height using the `video_size` argument.

For example:
```Bash
python polyp_detection.py --data /path-to-onnx-model/ --video_dir /path-to-video/ --video_size "(width, height)"
```
