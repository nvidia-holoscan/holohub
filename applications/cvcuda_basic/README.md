# Simple CV-CUDA application

This application demonstrates seamless interoperability between Holoscan tensors and CV-CUDA tensors. The image processing pipeline is just a simple flip of the video orientation.

# Running the Application

The simple CV-CUDA pipeline example can then be run via
```
python applications/cvcuda_basic/python/cvcuda_basic.py --data=/workspace/holohub/data/endoscopy
```
