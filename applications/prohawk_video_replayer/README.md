## ProHawk Vision Restoration Operator

The ProHawk Vision Operator is a groundbreaking solution that is transforming both healthcare and manufacturing industries by revolutionizing computer vision technology with its patented restoration capabilities. It seamlessly integrates into the NVIDIA Holoscan full-stack infrastructure, fundamentally altering the way healthcare professionals diagnose and treat patients, while also optimizing manufacturing processes. In healthcare, the ProHawk Vision Operator Plugin automatically interprets medical imaging frames, identifies real-world conditions, and employs precise control over ProHawk Vision Restoration algorithms, all driven by an objective mathematical model using quantitative measurements to enhance accuracy in diagnoses and treatments by restoring degraded frames. In manufacturing, the ProHawk Vision Operator Plugin algorithms reveal manufacturing line defects ensuring product quality.

## Application Controls

The operator can be controlled with keyboard shortcuts:

- **AFS (0)** - Automatic Filter Selection (AFS) ‚Äì Automatically and continuously adjust the image pixel values to maximize image detail and visibility.
- **LowLight (1)** - Lowlight preset filter that corrects lighting compromised imagery.
- **Vascular Detail (2)** - Vasculature Detail Preset Filter that reveals the fine details of vasculature structures without the need for dye or contrast agents.
- **Vapor (3)** - Vapor Preset Filter that removes vapor, smoke, and stream from the video.
- **Disable Restoration (d)** - Disable ProHawk Vision computer vision restoration.
- **Side-by-Side View (v)** - Display Side-by-Side (restored/non-restores) Video.
- **Display Menu Items (m)** - Display menus control items.
- **Quit (q)** - Exit the application
