# Prohawk video replayer

This application demonstrates how to use the Prohawk video processing operator on a pre-recorded video.
This application receives video from a previously recorded file via Holoscan's video_stream_replayer operator, and then works to enhance 
the imagery so that additional details may be seen in the video output. 
This application and operator provide various preset and detailed enhancement parameters that can be changed by the command menu display.
