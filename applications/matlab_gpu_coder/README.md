# Develop Holoscan Applications with MATLAB GPU Coder

This folder shows how to develop Holoscan applications that uses CUDA code generated by [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) [GPU Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/gpu-coder.html). The CUDA code can be compiled on either x86 or arm64.

## MATLAB Requirements

The applications have been tested on MATLAB R2023b, but should work on other versions of MATLAB.

The required MATLAB Toolboxes are:

* [GPU Coder Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/gpu-coder.html)
* To generate simulated data:
    * [Phased Array System Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/phased-array.html)
    * [Communications Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/communications.html)
* To compile on Jetson devices (arm64):
    * [Embedded Coder Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html)
    * [MATLAB Coder Support Package for NVIDIA Jetson and NVIDIA DRIVE Platforms](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/nvidia/)
    * Look at [this documentation](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/coder/nvidia/ug/install-and-setup-prerequisites.html) for making CUDA accessible to the MATLAB host machine
