# Colonoscopy Polyp Segmentation

Full workflow including a generic visualization of segmentation results from a polyp segmentation models.

## Quick Start

```bash
./holohub run colonoscopy_segmentation
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- The provided applications are configured to either use the AJA capture card for input stream, or a pre-recorded video of the colonoscopy data (replayer). Follow the [setup instructions from the user guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/aja_setup.html) to use the AJA capture card.

## Data

[üì¶Ô∏è (NGC) Sample App Data for AI Colonoscopy Segmentation of Polyps](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara-holoscan/resources/holoscan_colonoscopy_sample_data)

The data is automatically downloaded and converted to the correct format when building the application.
If you want to manually convert the video data, please refer to the instructions for using the [convert_video_to_gxf_entities](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/tree/main/scripts#convert_video_to_gxf_entitiespy) script.

## Build Instructions

To build the application in a runtime container:
```bash
./holohub build colonoscopy_segmentation
```

Or, to build the application in the host environment, install the application dependencies and then run:
```bash
./holohub build --local colonoscopy_segmentation
```

## Run Instructions

### Application Presets

To run the application with the pre-recorded colonoscopy sample video
```bash
./holohub run colonoscopy_segmentation replayer
```

To run the application with input from an AJA video capture card:
```bash
./holohub run colonoscopy_segmentation aja
```

### Application Configurations

To pass runtime arguments to the application:
```bash
./holohub run colonoscopy_segmentation --run-args="--contours --source=\"replayer\""
```

### CLI Parameters

```bash
usage: colonoscopy_segmentation.py [-h] [-s {replayer,aja}] [-c CONFIG] [-d DATA] [--contours | --no-contours]

Colonoscopy segmentation demo application.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {replayer,aja}, --source {replayer,aja}
                        If 'replayer', replay a prerecorded video. If 'aja' use an AJA capture card as the source (default: replayer).
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Set config path to override the default config file location
  -d DATA, --data DATA  Set the data path
  --contours, --no-contours
                        Show segmentation contours instead of mask (default: False)
```

## VS Code Dev Container

To start the the Dev Container, run the following command from the root directory of Holohub:

```bash
./holohub vscode
```

### VS Code Launch Profiles

There are two launch profiles configured for this application:

1. **(debugpy) colonoscopy_segmentation/python**: Launch colonoscopy_segmentation using a launch profile that enables debugging of Python code.
2. **(pythoncpp) colonoscopy_segmentation/python**: Launch colonoscopy_segmentation using a launch profile that enables debugging of Python and C++ code.

Note: the launch profile starts the application with Video Replayer. To adjust the arguments of the application, open [launch.json](../../.vscode/launch.json), find the launch profile named `(debugpy) colonoscopy_segmentation/python`, and adjust the `args` field as needed.
