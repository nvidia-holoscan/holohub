# H.264 Endoscopy Tool Tracking Application

The application showcases how to use H.264 video source as input to and output
from the Holoscan pipeline. This application is a modified version of Endoscopy
Tool Tracking reference application in Holoscan SDK that supports H.264
elementary streams as the input and output.

_The H.264 video decode operators do not adjust framerate as it reads the
elementary stream input. As a result the video stream can be displayed as
quickly as the decoding can be performed. This application uses
`PeriodicCondition` to play video at the same speed as the source video._

## Requirements

This application is configured to use H.264 elementary stream from endoscopy
sample data as input. The recording of the output can be enabled by setting
`record_output` flag in the config file to `true`. If the `record_output` flag
in the config file is set to `true`, the output of the pipeline is again
recorded to a H.264 elementary stream on the disk, file name / path for this
can be specified in the 'h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking.yaml' file.

### Data

[üì¶Ô∏è (NGC) Sample App Data for AI-based Endoscopy Tool Tracking](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara-holoscan/resources/holoscan_endoscopy_sample_data)

The data is automatically downloaded when building the application.

## Building And Running H.264 Endoscopy Tool Tracking Application

Follow steps in README.md from parents directory to build and run the Holohub
dev container. Once inside the Holohub dev container, follow steps mentioned
below to build and run H.264 Endoscopy Tool Tracking application.

## Building the application

Once inside Holohub dev container, run below command from a top level Holohub
directory.

```bash
./run build h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking
```

## Running the application

* Running the application from the top level Holohub directory

```bash
./run launch h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking
```

* Running the application `h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking` from the build directory.

```bash
cd <build_dir>/applications/h264/h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking/ \
  && ./h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking --data <HOLOHUB_DATA_DIR>/endoscopy
```

## Enable recording of the output

The recording of the output can be enabled by setting `record_output` flag in
the config file
`<build_dir>/applications/h264/endoscopy_tool_tracking/h264_endoscopy_tool_tracking.yaml`
to `true`.
