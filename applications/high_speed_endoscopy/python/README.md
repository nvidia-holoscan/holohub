2. a NVIDIA ConnectX SmartNIC with Rivermax SDK and drivers installed (see [prerequisites](../../README.md#prerequisites))
3. a display with high refresh rate to keep up with the camera's framerate
4. [additional setups](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/additional_setup.html) to reduce latency
